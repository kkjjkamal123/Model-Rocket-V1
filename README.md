## 🚀 What Is This?

This repository is a complete, first-principles model rocketry project built on **R-Candy (KNSB sugar propellant)** — designed, simulated, and documented by an engineering student. The primary goal is a clean, stable flight to **200–300 m apogee** using a custom-cast B-class motor — a realistic, achievable target for a first build.

The project covers everything: the physics and chemistry behind the propellant, CAD and 3D-print files for every structural component, OpenRocket `.ork` simulation files with custom `.eng` motor curves, step-by-step build procedures, and full safety documentation.

This is not a kit. Every dimension, every fin, every gram of propellant is understood and intentional.

## 🧪 Propellant — KNSB 65:35

The fuel is **KNSB: potassium nitrate + sorbitol** at a 65:35 mass ratio. This is the standard beginner sugar propellant — safer than KNSU (sucrose) because sorbitol melts at a lower temperature (~110 °C vs 150 °C+), giving a wider, more forgiving casting window.

| Compound | Role | Mass (4 g grain) |
|---|---|---|
| Potassium nitrate KNO₃ | Oxidiser | **2.6 g** |
| Sorbitol C₆H₁₄O₆ | Fuel / binder | **1.4 g** |

**Delivered specific impulse:** ~130 s · **Burn character:** progressive, low slag

### ⚗️ Casting Summary

1. Grind KNO₃ alone to fine powder (no fuel present, no flame)
2. Melt sorbitol in a dedicated metal pan, off open flame, thermometer ≤120 °C
3. Remove from heat — stir in KNO₃ until a uniform smooth paste forms
4. If mix smokes or darkens → flood with water and discard immediately
5. Cast around the 8 mm coring rod, tap out bubbles, cure fully, inspect for cracks

> Full casting procedure with safety protocols is in `BUILD_GUIDE.md`.

## 🖨️ 3D Printing — What to Print

All STL files are validated watertight. Motor casing, nozzle, and bulkhead must **never** be printed — use machined graphite/aluminium for those.

| File | Qty | Material | Infill | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `nose_cone.stl` | 1 | PLA or PETG | 15–20% | 3 perimeters, 0.2 mm layer |
| `fin_x1_print3.stl` | 3 | PETG or carbon PETG | 30–40% | Print each fin flat for grain alignment |
| `fin_alignment_jig.stl` | 1 | PLA | 10% | Assembly aid — discard after glue sets |
| `launch_lug.stl` | 1 | PETG | 25% | Drill to match your rail rod diameter |

**Orientation:** print fins flat on the bed (skin parallel to fin surface). Sand the mating surfaces to 120 grit before epoxying.

> ⚠ Never print nozzle, motor casing, retaining bulkhead, or any part that contacts combustion gases.

---

## 🔭 Simulation — OpenRocket

All simulation is done in **OpenRocket** (free, open-source). The `.ork` file contains the full Barrowman aerodynamic model, all component masses, and the configured motor.

### Setup in 3 steps

```
1. File → Preferences → User-defined thrust curves → Add file
   → select RCandy_B4_RC-B4.eng → OK → Restart OpenRocket

2. File → Open → RCandy_250m.ork

3. Simulate → Run simulation
   Check: Stability ≥ 1.5 cal  |  Rail-exit velocity ≥ 15 m/s
```

### Flight profile (simulated, ISA atmosphere, 2 m/s wind)

| Phase | Time | Altitude |
|---|---|---|
| Ignition & rail-exit | 0 s | 0 m |
| Motor burnout | ~0.5 s | ~18 m |
| Coast to apogee | ~3.5 s | **~250 m** |
| Streamer deploy | ~3.5 s | 250 m |
| Ground recovery | ~65 s | 0 m |

> **Always re-simulate after the rocket is fully built and weighed.** An extra 5 g shifts the apogee by tens of metres.

## 🔧 Build Overview

Full procedure is in `BUILD_GUIDE.md`. The sequence at a glance:

```
[1] Gather materials & verify all masses
[2] Cut & finish body tube (210 mm)
[3] Print and sand nose cone + fins
[4] Mark fin lines on tube (use tube_wrap template)
[5] Epoxy fins using alignment jig — 120° spacing
[6] Apply 3 mm fillet radius at fin roots
[7] Glue motor mount, add positive retention
[8] Anchor Kevlar shock cord → attach streamer
[9] Prime, paint, and polish airframe
[10] Simulate in OpenRocket (must: ≥1.5 cal, ≥15 m/s rail-exit)
[11] Cast KNSB grain (with mentor, off open flame, ≤120 °C)
[12] Assemble motor — graphite nozzle, forward bulkhead, delay
[13] Range: 1 m rail, e-match, all personnel ≥30 m behind cover
[14] Fire — log actual vs predicted apogee
```

## ⚠️ Safety — Non-Negotiable

Sugar motors are **live ordnance**. These rules are not suggestions.

- Never work alone — an **experienced mentor must be present** at every stage
- Legal authorisation for your site and motor class is mandatory before any live work
- Eye protection at all times during casting, assembly, and flight
- Cast off open flame — never exceed 120 °C, never rush the cool-down
- Electric ignition only — **≥30 m behind a solid barrier**, continuity check before arming
- Never 3D-print combustion-path parts (nozzle, casing, bulkhead) — PLA/PETG will fail catastrophically
- Discard any batch that smokes, darkens, or shows uneven mixing — do not fly a suspect grain
- Store finished motors in a cool, dry location — separated from igniters until range day

## 🔬 Key Engineering Concepts

<details>
<summary><strong>Why KNSB instead of KNSU?</strong></summary>

KNSU uses sucrose as the fuel, which melts at ~150 °C — a hot, narrow window that punishes inattention with scorching or partial decomposition. KNSB uses sorbitol (~110 °C melt), which is far more forgiving on a first cast. Both deliver similar specific impulse (~130 s). For a first build, KNSB is the correct choice.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why 65:35 KNO₃:fuel ratio?</strong></summary>

65:35 sits near the stoichiometric balance that maximises delivered Isp in castable sugar propellants. Moving toward more oxidiser increases burn temperature and rate, eventually becoming uncontrollable. Moving toward more fuel creates a lazy, low-performance burn with excess carbon residue. 65:35 is the proven, community-validated sweet spot.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is stability calibres?</strong></summary>

Stability = (CG − CP) / diameter, where CG is the centre of gravity and CP is the centre of pressure. A value ≥ 1.5 cal means the rocket is 1.5 body-diameters nose-heavy — enough aerodynamic restoring force to keep it flying straight. Below ~1.0 cal the rocket is prone to weathercocking or going ballistic. OpenRocket computes this automatically; always verify before flight.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why can't I just print the nozzle?</strong></summary>

At ignition, the nozzle throat sees combustion gases at ~1600–1800 °C and chamber pressures of 3–10 MPa. PLA softens at 60 °C and PETG at ~85 °C — both fail instantly. Nozzles must be machined from graphite (preferred), mild steel, or similar refractory materials. This is not a workaround — it is a structural requirement.
